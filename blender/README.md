## Blender Python Notes

Quickstart when running in blender
- start Blender
- go to Scripting tab
- key module is bpy. ( press control + space for autocomplete to see functions)

When doing normal modelling, tab to the Scripting tab to see the python commands it generates (though, they are usually chock full of parameters, mostly defaults but at least you can see when the module is called to do the task)
